#+TITLE:BinarySearch


*** Idenitification

- If the array given is SORTED,then always go for Binary Search approach.

- Mid can be calculated as:
#+begin_src ini

 mid= start + (end-start)/2
#+end_src
Instead of start+end /2 to avoid Integer overflow (testcases have these)

- For types of problems involving rotated sorted array or find element in such a rotated sorted array ,thumb rule to remember

 #+begin_src ini

   No of rotations = index of minimum element
 #+end_src

 And once you get the min element and its index u can use that as starting mid and apply binarySearch from there.
