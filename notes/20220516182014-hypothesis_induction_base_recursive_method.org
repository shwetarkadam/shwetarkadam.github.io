#+TITLE: Hypothesis Induction Base Recursive Method

Hypothesis Induction Base Method :

Better for tree,linked lists,stack using problems.

GOAL here is to *make input SMALLER*

- Hypothesis:
  In this, assume a function with its neceesary input and what we expect in that output.
 #+begin_bash
  solveHeightOfBinaryTree(Node root )-> 3

  solveHeightOfBinaryTree(Node subnodeAtLevel2) -> 2
 #+end_bash

- Induction:
  This invlolves taking a 1 scenario (easiest one ) and storing result in temp or later to be used later
  And then process next element.
  Make sure you make diagrams and think.

- Base Condition:
  This can be thought in 2 ways :
  - Think of the smallest valid input
    OR
  - Think of the smalled Invalid input
