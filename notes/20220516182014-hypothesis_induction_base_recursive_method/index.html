<p>Hypothesis Induction Base Method :</p>
<p>Better for tree,linked lists,stack using problems.</p>
<p>GOAL here is to <strong>make input SMALLER</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypothesis:
In this, assume a function with its neceesary input and what we expect in that output.</p>
<p>solveHeightOfBinaryTree(Node root )-> 3</p>
<p>solveHeightOfBinaryTree(Node subnodeAtLevel2) -> 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Induction:
This invlolves taking a 1 scenario (easiest one ) and storing result in temp or later to be used later
And then process next element.
Make sure you make diagrams and think.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base Condition:
This can be thought in 2 ways :</p>
<ul>
<li>Think of the smallest valid input
OR</li>
<li>Think of the smalled Invalid input</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
