#+title: Type Inference

Type inference refers to automatic detection of the type (int ,string) in a code expression.
The compiler is intelligent enough to know the data tpe

Exapmle:
#+begin_src java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface MyComparator{
    public  boolean compare(int n1,int n2);
}
#+end_src
#+begin_src java
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     //defined the above interface compare method here using lambda expression.
     //here we dont provide the type "int" since compiler is able to infer that it is int data type.Compiler is intelligent enough to know that
        MyComparator obj=(n1,n2)->n1>n2;

        boolean compare=obj.compare(40,30);
    }
}
#+end_src
#+begin_src
OUTPUT:
true
#+end_src
The property (int) is inferred by compiler itself
