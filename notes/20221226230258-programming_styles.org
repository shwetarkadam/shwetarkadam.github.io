#+title: Programming Styles

- **Imperative Style**
 -- We tell the code =What to do= and =How to do it=
- **Declarative Style**
 -- We tell the code =What to do= and NOT focus on =how to do it= . For example :using a library to tell what to do .
- **Functional Style**
 -- It is kind of declarative style of programming.
 -- All functional Style is declarative but not all declarative style is functional
