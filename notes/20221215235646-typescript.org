#+title: Typescript

Typescript is a super set of Javascript. It validates your Javascript ahead of time with static type checking.
***** Why  typscript ?
- Code is interpreted by the browser but if the code is broken then it gives runtime errors (usually when you right click and check for console.log errors in old websites)
- Typescript prevents this by extending Javascript with types. Where an IDE like vscode provides feedback.
- It behaves like a compiler.
  #+begin_src typescript
let appName : String   //explicit
let appName ="string"  //implicit
let appName=any="string" //loosely typed
  #+end_src
