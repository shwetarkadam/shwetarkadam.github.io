#+title: Dependency Injection
 Dependency Injection is a software design pattern where a class or a component receives its dependencies from an external source instead of creating them directly or depending on some global state variable

 Example: In Java instead of creating Java objects using =new= keyword we can use =@Autowired= annotation for creating objects via dependency injection
