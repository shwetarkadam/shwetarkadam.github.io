Aditya Verma Approach to sliding window :
***** Identificatiion :
1. Could be array or string.
2. There is a window which is *continous* (doesnt break) .
3. Question might ask related to *subarray or substring* .Also it can ask largest or smallest value in the question.
4. Window size will be given or the question might ask to find out window size.


   Window size | Condition


2 Types of Sliding window problems:
 a. Fixed size window: If window size is given then based on some condition we return min or max value.
 b. Variable size window: We are given some condition and we have to find the window size based on that condition.


***** Variable size window:
Example:If a partciaulr sum is given ,find the largest sub array (window size) having that sum
