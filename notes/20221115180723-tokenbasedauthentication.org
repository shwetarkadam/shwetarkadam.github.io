#+title: Token Based Authentication


Token Based authentication allows users to verify their identity using credntials and in this case server returns a unique access token (mostly in Bearer token  header ) or signed token such as JWT. As long as the token is valid ,user can access the web page or api. The token is stored on client side


Client -> Sends login creds -> Server
Client <- Server authenticates and returns a signed token(JWT or Bearer )
CLient stores the token in local storage/ cookie
Client makes requests to server and makes sure this token is added in Bearer header or as POST request parameter
CLient -> Server decodes the token or jwt and if token valid sends the requested data
Once user logs out token is destroyed or a validity period can be set for the token

Tokens are like a time stamped tickets. As long as token is valid ,user is allowed to perform operations
